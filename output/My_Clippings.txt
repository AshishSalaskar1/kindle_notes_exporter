‘What’s most humiliating in Delhi? Ghar mein ghus kar maa-baap ke saamne pitai (Getting beaten up in front of your parents). Uncle held off Karan’s screaming parents. Mohini wielded her hockey stick like a mace. Three hairline fractures in his hands, two broken ribs. When she pushed him off the stairs, his broken femur jutted out of his thigh. That’s the limp Karan carries today.’

Ironically, this fixation on the positive—on what’s better, what’s superior—only serves to remind us over and over again of what we are not, of what we lack, of what we should have been but failed to be.

People are afraid to pursue their most important dreams, because they feel that they don't deserve them, or that they'll be unable to achieve them. We, their hearts, become fearful just thinking of loved ones who go away forever, or of moments that could have been good but weren't, or of treasures that might have been found but were forever hidden in the sands. Because, when these things happen, we suffer terribly.”

before a dream is realized, the Soul of the World tests everything that was learned along the way. It does this not because it is evil, but so that we can, in addition to realizing our dreams, master the lessons we've learned as we've moved toward that dream. That's the point at which most people give up. It's the point at which, as we say in the language of the desert, one 'dies of thirst just when the palm trees have appeared on the horizon.'

the phone the whole night. Finally at five am, we had said goodnight and fallen asleep. I couldn’t of course, wake up in time for college. My parents had been worried and my mother had presumed that I was ill, and had let me sleep. Aman on the other hand, had been woken up by his hostel-mates and had promptly fallen asleep in class and been sent out. I smile at the memory. Being in bed the whole day with nothing to do but rest gives me a lot of time to think and my thoughts keep rushing back to Aman. God, I miss him so much now. I wonder how he is and if he is happy. I wonder if he thinks of me as much as I think of him. I wonder if he is single or has a girlfriend now. The very thought of a girlfriend causes a sinking feeling in my stomach. It is ridiculous to feel this way, because I am already married and I was the one who walked away from him. How could I ever make him understand that it has broken my heart as much as it had broken his? I did what had to be done at that time. My mother’s
