‘What’s most humiliating in Delhi? Ghar mein ghus kar maa-baap ke saamne pitai (Getting beaten up in front of your parents). Uncle held off Karan’s screaming parents. Mohini wielded her hockey stick like a mace. Three hairline fractures in his hands, two broken ribs. When she pushed him off the stairs, his broken femur jutted out of his thigh. That’s the limp Karan carries today.’

Because, when these things happen, we suffer terribly.”

before a dream is realized, the Soul of the World tests everything that was learned along the way. It does this not because it is evil, but so that we can, in addition to realizing our dreams, master the lessons we've learned as we've moved toward that dream. That's the point at which most people give up. It's the point at which, as we say in the language of the desert, one 'dies of thirst just when the palm trees have appeared on the horizon.'

My parents had been worried and my mother had presumed that I was ill, and had let me sleep. Aman on the other hand, had been woken up by his hostel-mates and had promptly fallen asleep in class and been sent out. I smile at the memory. Being in bed the whole day with nothing to do but rest gives me a lot of time to think and my thoughts keep rushing back to Aman. God, I miss him so much now. I wonder how he is and if he is happy. I wonder if he thinks of me as much as I think of him. I wonder if he is single or has a girlfriend now. The very thought of a girlfriend causes a sinking feeling in my stomach. It is ridiculous to feel this way, because I am already married and I was the one who walked away from him. How could I ever make him understand that it has broken my heart as much as it had broken his? I did what had to be done at that time. My mother’s

In 2013, a research team in Japan, led by Dr. Yukiyasu Kamitani at the Advanced Telecommunications Research Institute International in Kyoto, found an ingenious way to address the question. They essentially cracked the code of an individual’s dream for the very first time and, in doing so, led us to an ethically uncomfortable place.

A theory that cannot be discerned true or false in this way will always be abandoned by science, and that is precisely what happened to Freud and his psychoanalytic practices.

The exercise, however, importantly reveals the dangers of generic interpretations that feel very personal and uniquely individual, yet scientifically hold no specificity whatsoever.

Between 35 and 55 percent of emotional themes and concerns that participants were having while they were awake during the day powerfully and unambiguously resurfaced in the dreams they were having at night. The commonalities were just as clear to the participants themselves, who gave similarly confident judgments when asked to compare their own dream reports with their waking reports.

However, when the (human) brain produces REM sleep in this specific way, it may also produce this thing we call dreaming. Dreams, like heat from a lightbulb, may serve no function. Dreams may simply be epiphenomena of no use or consequence. They are merely an unintended by-product of REM sleep.

Is the REM-sleep dreaming state a perfectly designed nocturnal soothing balm—one that removes the emotional sharp edges of our daily lives? It seemed so from everything neurobiology and neurophysiology was telling us (me). If so, we should awake feeling better about distressing events of the day(s) prior.

process of REM-sleep dreaming accomplishes two critical goals: (1) sleeping to remember the details of those valuable, salient experiences, integrating them with existing knowledge and putting them into autobiographical perspective, yet (2) sleeping to forget, or dissolve, the visceral, painful emotional charge that had previously been wrapped around those memories. If true, it would suggest that the dream state supports a form of introspective life review, to therapeutic ends.

Think back to your childhood and try to recall some of the strongest memories you have. What you will notice is that almost all of them will be memories of an emotional nature: perhaps a particularly frightening experience of being separated from your parents, or almost being hit by a car on the street. Also notice, however, that your recall of these detailed memories is no longer accompanied by the same degree of emotion that was present at the time of the experience. You have not forgotten the memory, but you have cast off the emotional charge, or at least a significant amount of it. You can accurately relive the memory, but you do not regurgitate the same visceral reaction that was present and imprinted at the time of the episode.

Indeed, I argued that if REM sleep did not perform this operation, we’d all be left with a state of chronic anxiety in our autobiographical memory networks; every time we recalled something salient, not only would we recall the details of the memory, but we would relive the same stressful emotional charge all over again.

As the theory predicted, it was the dreaming state of REM sleep—and specific patterns of electrical activity that reflected the drop in stress-related brain chemistry during the dream state—that determined the success of overnight therapy from one individual to the next.
